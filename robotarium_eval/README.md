# How to Run on the Robotarium
The Robotarium only accepts files, not folders. Additionally, the file types it accepts is limited.
Therefore, the following, at times strange, steps are necessary. <br>

1. Copy the agent file you are using to this folder (the standard ones from epymarl are already here)

## Note on File Types
The acceptable files types in the Robotarium are ` .m, .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, .tiff, .bmp, .py, .mat, .npy, and .mexa64 ` <br>
Therefore, I am using `.tiff` for `.th` files, `.mat` for `.json` files, and `.npy` for `.yaml` files. It is not required you follow these conventions.
